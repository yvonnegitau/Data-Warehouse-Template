# Modern Data Stack for Women Football Data Warehouse

The goal of this project is to experiment on the different flavours of modern data stack. The objective is to understand the pros and cons of the different architecture, tools and methodologies. The data being used is the Women Football data. The final output will be a fully built stack that can be installed in the different cloud providers and can also run locally.

Any AI in the future.... We will see.
